longitudinal GWAS pipeline
================================================================

Documentation for the `longitudinal GWAS pipeline <https://github.com/michael-ta/longitudinal-GWAS-pipeline>`_
project. This project aims to provide a reproducible and scalable solution to perform genome wide association
studies (GWAS) on longitudinal outcomes. The longGWAS computational pipeline was developed using [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/index.html) 
for researchers to deploy and perform custom GWAS analyses with ease.
