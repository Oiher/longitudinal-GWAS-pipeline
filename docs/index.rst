GWAS Pipeline for Longitudinal Analysis  using Nextflow + Docker
================================================================

Documentation for the `longitudinal GWAS pipeline <https://github.com/michael-ta/longitudinal-GWAS-pipeline>`_
project. This project aims to provide a reproducible and scalable solution to perform genome wide association
studies (GWAS) on longitudinal outcomes. We have put together a Nextflow workflow and accompanying Docker image
for researchers to deploy and use to analyze whole genome sequencing data.
